## We want a long term commitment, can you deliver?

We only take on a select few projects and are usually in it for the long term. We are quite picky. Sometimes we dedicate ourselves to a project for several years and sometimes our involvement is shorter. But we always screen all our clients very carefully before making a commitment. We will typically look at your business plan and your financing as a first step. Then we like to meet you and get to know you. Going on a startup journey together is like becoming a family. We will face ups and downs along the way and itâ€™s important that we can work well together.

We prefer to work with local companies in the Stockholm, Sweden or Nordics area. But we will also consider international projects if your business is promising. We can work both remote and in office, depending on your preference and work style (but will always prefer remote teams whenever possible).
