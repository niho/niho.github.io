## Can scale up quickly
Finding the perfect co-founder or employee to hire as a CTO can take a long time and be frustrating when you need to scale up quickly or build your first prototype. Hiring a consultant can be a sensible option because it allows you to focus on what is important right now: delivering value to your customers.

## Long experience / safe bet
We have a very long experience from the startup world (+15 years). We know not only the tech parts, but also the business side of things, very, very well. On the other hand, when you find a co-founder or employee CTO it is probably their first time in that role and they will have to learn on the job. It requires a certain kind of person with very specific skill sets to be successful. Sometimes it will turn out to be a failed hire, which can risk your entire business failing. Why take that risk? 

## Can use network for hiring engineers
One of the hardest parts of running a tech startup is to hire great team of engineers. It is absolutely essential for your success, but it will eat up the majority of your time. We already have a huge network of great engineers that we have worked with before and that we can head-hunt for you. We also have a long experience with the recruitment process and can help you with interviews, code tests, culture fit, etc.

## Less administration and simpler accounting
Hiring a consultant means less administrativ overhead for you and much simpler accounting. You don't need to worry about things like employee contracts, tax reporting, vaccation pay, pension or any other of that stuff.

## Can deduct the VAT to increase your margins/profit
An often forgotten, but hugely important benefit of hiring a consultant is that you can deduct the VAT on the consulting fee. For small startups with very little revenue it can in practice mean that you make all your sales in effect tax free. Saving a huge amount of money. Smart, right? :)

## Can use public financing options like Almi, Vinnova or EU grants to pay for consulting fees
An important source of financing for many early stage startups is public grants from organisations like Almi and Vinnova in Sweden or EU grants in other countries. For almost all such grants you are not allowed to use the money to pay your own wages, but it is usally fine to use the money to hire consultants (which is what the grant money is typically intended for).

## Don’t need to give away shares in your company
When you hire a competent and skilled CTO either as a co-founder or an employee they will typically demand between 10-30% of your company. That seems like a lot to give away.

## Can end the collaboration quickly if things don’t work out
An employee or co-founder that does not work out for some reason can be really, really hard to get rid of and turn into a very expensive mess. Especially if they are also a share holder in your company. With a CTO consultant, on the other hand, you can decide to end the contract whenever you want, no questions asked, no fuss.

## Don’t have to be full time if you don’t need it
We are flexible with the number of hours we work for you. Maybe you have a limited budget or simply don't need very much engineering work to build your product. We will adapt to your needs.

## Can introduce you to investors
Since we have founded a number of companies ourselves we have a lot of investor contacts that know us and trust us. Especially in the Stockholm region. We can make an introduction when the time and fit is right.

## You don’t have to worry about the technical due diligence when you raise your seed round
When your company is starting to grow and you need to raise a seed or Series A round, the lead investor will always do an indepth technical due dilligence on your company before signing. It is not unusual for deals to break down because the tech turns out to be a mess. We have done several technical DDs before and can guarantee that if we are responsible for designing your technical architecture and processes, you will never have to loose any sleep over it.

Want us to help you prepare for a technical DD or do you need someone to do a technical DD on a company you are investing in? Please [contact us](mailto:info@niklasholmgren.com). We would love to help out.
