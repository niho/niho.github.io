title: Consulting for the Age of Conceptual Clarity
---

## What I do
I help organizations and individuals think clearly about what they’re building, why it matters, and what it means — especially when the answers aren’t _obvious_. In an era where generative AI can execute faster than humans can decide, the bottleneck is no longer implementation. It’s meaning. That’s where I come in.

## My Approach
I combine **philosophical thinking** with **product and technical experience** to bring clarity where others bring complexity. My clients call me when:

- There’s too much noise and no clear north star.
- Execution is moving fast, but no one’s sure it’s the right direction.
- Strategy decks feel hollow, misaligned, or disconnected from real insight.
- The organization is solving _the wrong problem_.
- Ethical, creative, or cultural questions are being avoided.

I don’t arrive with cookie-cutter frameworks. I co-create meaning, structure, and direction tailored to your unique context.

## Services

### Strategic Framing Sprint
2–4 weeks | €10,000–€25,000

A short, intensive engagement to reframe a problem or clarify a strategic direction.

You get:
- Discovery sessions with key thinkers and decision-makers
- A conceptual model that reframes the issue
- A synthesis document or strategic memo you can act on

_For when you’re moving fast, but not sure if you’re moving in the right direction._

### Philosophical Innovation Workshop
Half-day or full-day | €3,000–€9,000

A guided workshop to open up thinking, challenge assumptions, and illuminate new directions.

Common themes:
- "Are we solving a real human problem?"
- "What does meaningful innovation look like here?"
- "How do our systems shape human behavior?"

_For teams or leaders ready to ask deeper questions — and get better answers._

### Advisory Retainer
Monthly | From €2,500/month

Ongoing access to high-trust philosophical and strategic dialogue.

You get:
- 2–4 meetings/month
- Feedback on strategy docs, product directions, or team decisions

### 1:1 Idea Partner Sessions
By invitation | €350–€750/hour

Private philosophical-strategic conversations to clarify ideas, transitions, or big questions.

For founders, creatives, and deep generalists.

_For those navigating the lonely, high-stakes edges of modern work._
