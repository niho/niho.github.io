title: Consulting for the Age of Conceptual Clarity
---

## What I do
I help organizations and individuals think clearly about what they’re building, why it matters, and what it means — especially when the answers aren’t _obvious_. In an era where generative AI can execute faster than humans can decide, the bottleneck is no longer implementation. It’s meaning. That’s where I come in.

## My Approach
I combine **philosophical thinking** with **product, design, and technical experience** to bring clarity where others bring complexity.

## Services

### Strategic Framing Sprint
A short, intensive engagement to reframe a problem or clarify a strategic direction. _For when you’re moving fast, but not sure if you’re moving in the right direction._

### Design Thinking Workshop
A guided workshop to open up thinking, challenge assumptions, and illuminate new directions. _For teams or leaders ready to ask deeper questions — and get better answers._

## Why Work With Me?
I’m Niklas Holmgren — philosopher by training, maker by experience. For over 20 years, I’ve worked with technology, product, and creative teams. My gift lies in **connecting deep thinking to real-world action**.

Now, I help ambitious leaders, founders, and creatives think more clearly — and act more wisely — in a time when ideas matter more than execution.
